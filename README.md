## Portfolio for Juniper

# Description
Here is an art portfolio for Juniper. She wanted a way to easily add art one of several different medium categories, and to allow viewers to select which medium type to view. Clicking on an image blows up the image and displays the piece's description. A small navigation menu brings the viewer to either an 'About Me', 'Blog', or 'Home' page. There is a hidden admin page that allows Juniper to upload new art, edit existing art, and delete art.
